================================================================================
1. PRE-DEPLOYMENT PLANNING
================================================================================

BEFORE YOU BEGIN:

* Choose a dedicated server computer (physical or VM)
  - Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
  - Minimum: 4GB RAM, 50GB disk space
  - Recommended: 8GB RAM, 100GB+ disk space for large deployments

* Decide on a static IP address or hostname for the server
  - Example: 192.168.1.100 or simplesight.company.local
  - This MUST be configured before deploying agents
  - See NETWORK_CONFIGURATION.txt for details

* Determine server accessibility
  - On-premises only?
  - Remote access via VPN?

* Plan agent deployment strategy
  - Manual deployment per-device?
  - Group Policy deployment? (domain-joined computers)
  - Remote deployment via RMM tool? (MSPs)

* Backup strategy
  - Local backup of database file?
  - Windows Server Backup?
  - Third-party backup solution?

================================================================================
2. SERVER DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

STEP 1: RUN SERVER INSTALLER
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download SimpleSightServerInstaller.exe
2. Right-click → Run as Administrator
3. Follow the installation wizard:

   a) Server Hostname
      - Use the computer's network name OR IP address
      - Examples: "OFFICE-SERVER", "simplesight", "192.168.1.100"
      - This goes into the TLS certificate

   b) Certificate Installation
      - It's recommended to leave "Install certificate to Trusted Root" CHECKED
      - This allows the browser to trust HTTPS on the local server.
      - The agent installer will have the generated certificate packaged in.

   c) Server Port
      - Default: 8000
      - Use 443 for standard HTTPS (may conflict with IIS/other services)
      - Firewall rules will need to allow this port

   d) Admin Credentials
      - Choose a strong password (minimum 8 characters)
      - This is your web UI login
      - Secure this password somewhere - password recovery is not yet implemented, a full reinstall would be required if lost.

   e) Database Options
      - First install: Creates new database
      - Reinstall: Option to keep existing data in uninstall wizard

4. Wait a few minutes for installation to complete
   - Server files extracted
   - Certificate generated and installed
   - Database initialized
   - Agent installer built automatically
   - Scheduled task created

5. Click Finish when complete


STEP 2: VERIFY SERVER IS RUNNING
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open browser on the server computer
2. Navigate to: https://localhost:8000 (or your configured port)
3. You should see the SimpleSight login page
   - If you see a certificate warning, the cert wasn't installed properly
   - If you can't connect, check Windows Firewall

4. Login with your admin credentials
5. You should see the dashboard with 0 devices


STEP 3: CONFIGURE WINDOWS FIREWALL
------------------------------------------------------------

The installer does NOT automatically create firewall rules. You may need to allow
inbound connections manually:

1. Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
2. Click "Inbound Rules" → "New Rule..."
3. Rule Type: Port
4. Protocol: TCP, Specific local port: 8000 (or your port)
5. Action: Allow the connection
6. Profile: Domain, Private (optionally Public if needed)
7. Name: "SimpleSight Server"
8. Click Finish

Test from another computer:
- Open browser
- Navigate to https://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000
- You should see login page (may get certificate warning if the agent/cert isn't installed - normal)


STEP 4: CONFIGURE STATIC IP (CRITICAL!)
------------------------------------------------------------

Agents need a consistent address to connect to. Choose one option:

OPTION A: Static IP (Recommended)
1. Open Network and Sharing Center
2. Change adapter settings
3. Right-click network adapter → Properties
4. Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" → Properties
5. Select "Use the following IP address"
6. Enter:
   - IP address: 192.168.1.100 (or your chosen IP)
   - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 (typical)
   - Default gateway: 192.168.1.1 (your router)
   - Preferred DNS: your preferred DNS server (such as 8.8.8.8) or your router
7. Click OK

OR configure DHCP Reservation on your router:
1. Find router admin interface (usually 192.168.1.1)
2. Find DHCP settings
3. Add reservation: MAC address → desired IP address
4. This ensures the server always gets the same IP

OPTION B: DNS Configuration
- Configure your domain DNS to point a hostname to the server
- Example: simplesight.company.local → 192.168.1.100
- Requires Active Directory or router DNS configuration
- See NETWORK_CONFIGURATION.txt for details

================================================================================
3. NETWORK CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

See NETWORK_CONFIGURATION.txt for detailed DNS and hosts file configuration.

Quick summary:
- Agents need to resolve your server hostname OR use IP address
- Static IP is simplest for small deployments
- Hosts file is acceptable for <50 devices
- DNS is recommended for 50+ devices

================================================================================
4. AGENT DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

LOCATE THE AGENT INSTALLER
------------------------------------------------------------

After server installation completes, the agent installer is ready:

Location: C:\Program Files\SimpleSight Server\agent\SimpleSightInstaller.exe

This file is standalone and can be copied to other computers.


DEPLOYMENT
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy SimpleSightInstaller.exe to a USB drive or network share
2. On each target computer:
   - Copy installer to local computer if on network share
   - Right-click → Run as Administrator
   - Follow the wizard:
     
     a) Server URL: https://192.168.1.100:8000 (use your server IP/hostname)
     b) Verify SSL: Unchecked (using self-signed certificate)
     c) Test Connection - should show green "OK"
     d) Admin username and password (from server installation)
     e) Test Credentials - should authenticate successfully
     f) Check-in interval: 4 hours (default)
     g) Wait 2 minutes for installation

3. Verify installation:
   - Check Programs and Features in Control Panel
   - Refresh web UI - device should appear within 1 minute

DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------

After deploying agents:

1. Wait 2-5 minutes for initial check-in
2. Open web UI
3. Navigate to Devices page
4. Verify devices appear with "Online" status (last check-in < 6 hours)
5. Click a device to view inventory details

Expected data collected:
- System info (OS, version, architecture)
- Hardware (CPU, RAM, disks, manufacturer, model)
- Network (IP address, MAC address, adapters)
- Installed software (all programs from registry)
- Windows Update status

================================================================================
5. POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION
================================================================================

CHECKLIST:
------------------------------------------------------------

* Server accessible via HTTPS from all client computers
* Device inventory data populating correctly
* Check-ins occurring approx. every 4 hours (or configured interval)

COMMON ISSUES:
------------------------------------------------------------

See TROUBLESHOOTING.txt for detailed solutions.

Quick checks:

- Agent not appearing?
  - Check firewall on server
  - Verify agent can reach server URL (ping/browser test)
  - Check agent/server logs for errors
  - Reinstall, make sure IP address/hostname is correct

- Certificate errors?
  - Use "verify_ssl: false" in agent config (default)
  - Or distribute certificate to all computers
  - Or use IP address instead of hostname

- Database errors?
  - Verify server has write permissions to C:\ProgramData\SimpleSight (server must be running as admin)
  - Check disk space
  - Review server logs
