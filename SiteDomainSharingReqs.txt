Absolutely — here’s a **short, no-nonsense checklist** you can keep handy when you actually build this. Think of it as your “don’t overthink it” reference.

## ✅ Hybrid Multi-Domain Site Checklist

### 1. Domains & DNS

* [ ] Point **both domains** to the same server IP
* [ ] Enable HTTPS for **both domains** (single cert with both SANs)

---

### 2. Server Configuration

* [ ] Create **separate virtual hosts** for each domain
* [ ] Each vhost has its **own document root**
* [ ] Both vhosts include a **shared server config**

**Example**

* `example.com → /var/www/sites/example.com`
* `different.com → /var/www/sites/different.com`

---

### 3. Directory Structure

* [ ] Create a shared base directory:

  ```
  /var/www/shared
  ```
* [ ] Create per-domain site roots:

  ```
  /var/www/sites/example.com
  /var/www/sites/different.com
  ```
* [ ] Put common layouts, components, assets in `shared/`
* [ ] Put domain-specific pages & overrides in each site root

---

### 4. Request Handling (Fallback Logic)

* [ ] Requests check **domain-specific files first**
* [ ] If not found, fall back to **shared content**
* [ ] Missing files return a proper 404 from shared templates

---

### 5. Overrides Pattern

* [ ] Allow per-domain overrides for:

  * Headers / footers
  * Meta tags
  * Copy blocks
  * CTAs
* [ ] Default to shared templates when no override exists

---

### 6. SEO (Do This Early)

* [ ] Decide canonical strategy:

  * One primary domain **or**
  * Self-canonical per domain
* [ ] Add `<link rel="canonical">` on every page
* [ ] Separate `robots.txt` per domain if needed
* [ ] Generate sitemaps with **domain-aware URLs**

---

### 7. Assets

* [ ] Serve CSS/JS/images from shared paths or a CDN
* [ ] Avoid duplicating asset URLs across domains
* [ ] Ensure assets are not indexed as pages

---

### 8. App Awareness

* [ ] App reads the current domain (`Host` header)
* [ ] Domain used only for:

  * Overrides
  * SEO decisions
  * Optional branding differences

---

### 9. Guardrails

* [ ] No redirects between domains (unless intentional)
* [ ] Cookies scoped per domain
* [ ] Internal links use the **current domain**
* [ ] Avoid accidental cross-domain canonical tags

---

### 10. Future-Proofing

* [ ] Name site folders by actual domain
* [ ] Keep shared logic truly shared
* [ ] Assume domains may diverge later

---

If you ever forget *why* this works, remember the mantra:

> **Separate domains at the server level, share everything below.**

You’re set — this is a solid, professional setup.
