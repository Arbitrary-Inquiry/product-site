There I was, sitting alone in my office, in what I presumed must have been, at one time, an office chair. The moonlight seeped in through the cracks, reaching out to touch the candles that were sitting on my desk, flickering away.

It was then that I heard a rattle on the door—not quite gentle, but not firm, as if it were lacking confidence. "Come in!" I beckoned, and in through the frame slid a junior developer.

"Is this the place?" He asked.

"Depends," I told him, "what do you need?"

He looked to his sides, then slowly clicked the door shut behind him, before shuffling over to my desk and leaning almost to my face. "I've been vibe coding," he told me.

"Yeah? So has everyone else."

He stared at me for a moment, but then regained his composure, and looked me in the eyes for the first time. "I've heard it can be dangerous. Glaring security flaws. User data leaks. Sometimes even stuff that would make the developer... liable."

I readjusted my suspenders, pulling them up to the center of my shoulders, and then stood leaning on the desk with my hands almost touching his. "It's been known to happen. So what do you need?"

He withdrew his arms, almost as if he were a turtle trying to sneak into his shell, and took a step back. "I want to prevent that. I heard this is the place."

I nodded, then sat my hat down on the desk, the breeze of the act nearly snuffing the candles. "This is the place. We'll review it for you."

His muscles relaxed, and his posture opened, but a look soon crept over his face as he began to question. "I can get code review from anybody, though," he rightfully observed.

"Of course you can. But they're used to human code. Vibe coding? It's different. My guys have experience with it. Experience no one else has. That's why you're here."

He stood up firm and confident, slammed an envelope on the table, and reached across to grab my hand. "You're right. You've got yourself a deal."

I reached back and grabbed it, and the rest is history. The Case of the Claude Cloud-Server. The Curse of the Copilot Crashes. The Mystery of the Gemini Github Greps. They all started in a way something like that.

If that sounds like you, then you're in the right place. We believe you should be empowered by AI tools to be the best developer you can be—but we know they aren't perfect, and frankly, neither are you.

That's why we'd love to help by getting some human eyes on your code. Our developers will audit your code so that we can let you know if there's anything dangerous or duplicitous that could hurt you or your users, make sure your vibe code doesn't vibe-splode to keep your uptime metrics hot, or even just find the source of that one bug that's been plaguing you from the very beginning.

Whether it's a passion project or being pushed to prod, we'll work with you to make sure your code works. We may not have as many GPUs as your favourite LLM, but we bet you'll love our prompt responses just the same.

And that's not all—feel free to come back here any time to see the latest articles on common AI pitfalls, tips and tricks to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing environment, and interviews with people in the thick of AI assisted programming.
