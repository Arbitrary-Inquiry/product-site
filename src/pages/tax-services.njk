                        <p><strong>Andrew Wright — Co-founder, CFO</strong></p>
                        <p>Andrew handles the numbers — and he asks the uncomfortable questions about them. He's spent time cleaning up books that got messy fast: businesses that grew quicker than their bookkeeping, automation scripts cobbled together to save time that were quietly compounding errors, spreadsheets that nobody fully understood anymore but everyone was afraid to touch.</p>
                        <p>He knows what small business finances actually look like in practice. Not the clean version from a textbook — the version where three different people have been doing payroll three different ways, the QuickBooks export doesn't match the bank statement, and whoever set up the original spreadsheet left two years ago. He's seen it, untangled it, and built better systems in its place.</p>
                        <p><em>"Most people already know their books are a mess. They just need someone to fix it without judgment and tell them what to do differently going forward."</em></p>
