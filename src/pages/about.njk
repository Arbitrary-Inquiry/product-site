                    <p>Factory floors, payments infrastructure, production systems that break at 3am. We've seen what happens when things go wrong and had to fix it ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Andrew started this after a stint doing AI consulting. The kind where you parachute in, tell people to "leverage AI," and leave before anyone realizes nothing actually works. He kept seeing the same thing: someone ships fast with AI, the code's held together with duct tape, and then it's someone else's problem. Usually at 2am. He decided to be the someone else, except earlier — before things break.</p>
                    <p>We're new at packaging this as a service, but we've been finding the stuff that breaks for years.</p>
                    <p>Now we help people like you figure out what's actually going on in the code you shipped. Sometimes it's fine. Sometimes it's not. Either way, you'll know.</p>

                        <p class="team-title">Founder, CEO</p>
                        <p class="team-bio">Andrew runs the audits. He's been writing code since he was a kid and spent enough time in manufacturing and operations to spot when a process is broken. He'll tell you what actually needs fixing.</p>

                        <p class="team-title">Co-founder, CFO</p>
                        <p class="team-bio">Andrew handles the numbers and asks uncomfortable questions about ROI — exactly what you want before writing checks. Also the author of a <a href="https://a.co/d/hCzXMnl">#7,832,330<sup>&#8224;</sup> Amazon bestselling detective novel</a>, which explains why we're a detective agency. Only #1 at one thing though: auditing.</p>

                        <p class="team-title">Advisor, CTO-type stuff</p>
                        <p class="team-bio">Gerrit gets called in when we need someone who knows how hardware and software actually talk to each other. Builds robotics systems, currently studying electrical engineering. Our in-house "apple user" — ships single-handedly, literally. One hand's always occupied with fruit.</p>

                        <p class="team-title">Advisor, CISO-type stuff</p>
                        <p class="team-bio">Jason gets called in when something smells off security-wise. Most paranoid person we know, which is exactly what you want. Never met a Terms of Service he's afraid to test — that's how he knows where the real lines are. Probably reading an EULA recreationally right now.</p>

                    <p>PPS: Yes, the headshots are AI-generated. We're better at auditing code than taking photos of ourselves.</p>
